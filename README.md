# Hospital Data Management System

Developed a comprehensive database management system for a chain of hospitals across different cities, centralizing operations by organizing critical data into structured relations.

## Technologies Used
- Oracle Database
- SQL
- ERD Tools

## Key Contributions
- Designed relational schemas
- Wrote stored procedures and triggers
- Ensured data integrity and security
- Optimized queries for performance

## Project Description
Hospitals have a lot of patients coming in every day. It becomes crucial to store data about all the patients and doctors to understand the availability of doctors and to know which patient is assigned to which doctor. The database we are building also enables hospitals to understand what kind of diseases are more prevalent in a particular month or season. Based on that, hospitals can allocate more time for doctors dealing with the most prevalent diseases or appoint additional doctors during peak times. The database also helps store the salaries of staff and revenue generated by each hospital branch, assisting hospital management in cost-cutting if there are any losses.

Undoubtedly, designing a database for a hospital can become complex, so we have added some limitations:
- We have only one doctor for each treatment.
- One doctor works in only one specific location.
- A patient should visit the hospital only at one location.
- Each state has only one hospital branch.
- Patients buy medicines from the prescribed medical shops.
- Treatment and consultation are performed only once for each patient.
- A patient is not assigned to multiple doctors.
- Each hospital is associated with one pharmacy.

## Data Requirements

### Hospital Branches
- Each hospital has a name.
- Each hospital has a unique ID.
- List of services offered by each hospital.
- Total employees.
- Total doctors.
- Pharmacy name associated with the hospital.
- Hospital location.
- Hospital timings.
- Hospital contact information.
- Revenue per quarter.

### Patients
- Patient ID (unique).
- Patient Name.
- Patient Medical History (diseases previously diagnosed).
- Patient Age.
- Patient Contact Number.
- Patient Medical Insurance Details.
- Patient Disease.
- Previous Visiting Date.
- Purpose of Visiting.
- Medical Shop ID.
- Treatment ID (identifies the doctor assigned to the patient).

### Treatment Charges
- Treatment ID (identifies the patient).
- Treatment Name.
- Treatment Doctor ID (info about the doctor involved).
- Treatment Fee.
- Treatment Date and Time.
- Medicine ID.

### Employees
- Employee Name.
- Employee ID (unique).
- Designation.
- Work Hours.
- Hospital ID (to understand which hospital branch they work in).
- Salary.
- Age.
- Contact Number.

The reason we opted to create a separate table for doctors is that they can be assigned to different hospitals, while the ground staff remains constant.

### Medicines
- Medicine ID.
- Medicine Name.
- Medicine Cost.
- Medicine Manufacturing Company.

The medicines available in the pharmacy are stored, and extra stock can be brought in during months with a higher incidence of specific diseases.

### Pharmacy
- Pharmacy Name.
- Pharmacy ID.
- Hospital ID.
- Operating Hours.
- Contact Information.

## Business Goals
- Manage branches in different locations.
- Manage hospital information.
- Understand medical history of different diseases.
- Identify the most common diseases per state.
- Get details about the most prescribed medicines.
- Understand the frequency of diagnosed diseases.
- Retrieve information about doctors.
- Know patients' insurance details.
- Track the number of patients visiting particular hospitals.
- Identify which branch has higher revenue per quarter.
